Eastwood's ARC Principle: A Mathematical Framework for Recursive Amplification

This repository contains the complete research materials for Eastwood's Principle of Recursive Amplification (ARC Principle), documenting a mathematical framework that unifies findings across artificial intelligence, quantum computing, classical physics, and neuroscience.

CORE EQUATION: U = I × R^α
- U = Effective capability
- I = Base potential (structured asymmetry / "frozen disorder")
- R = Recursive depth (self-referential cycles)
- α = Scaling exponent, derived as α = 1/(1-β) where β is self-referential coupling

PRIORITY TIMELINE:
- 8 December 2024: Original manuscript with DKIM-verified timestamp (predates Google Willow announcement)
- 9 December 2024: Google announces Willow quantum processor with Λ = 2.14
- 20 January 2025: DeepSeek R1 released showing α ≈ 1.3-2.2 for sequential reasoning
- 6 February 2026: NYU announces time crystal paper in Physical Review Letters
- 9 February 2026: Paper III synthesises cross-domain convergence

KEY FINDING: Four independent research teams (working on quantum computers, AI language models, acoustic physics, and consciousness) converged on the same structural insight: recursive self-correction on structured asymmetry produces super-linear capability gains.

PAPERS INCLUDED:
- Paper I: Preliminary Evidence (Published 17 January 2026)
- Paper II: Experimental Validation (January 2026)
- Paper III: Cross-Domain Unification (9 February 2026) ← NEW

FALSIFICATION: The framework specifies ten explicit ways to prove it wrong, inviting scientific scrutiny.

Eastwood's ARC Principle: Cross-Domain Unification of Recursive Amplification Across AI, Quantum Computing, and Physics

Published: 9 February 2026
Version: 6.1

This paper synthesises convergent evidence from four independent research programmes:
- AI: DeepSeek R1 (sequential α ≈ 1.3-2.2, parallel α ≈ 0)
- Quantum: Google Willow (exponential error suppression, Λ = 2.14)
- Physics: NYU Time Crystals (frozen disorder + feedback = temporal order)
- Neuroscience: COGITATE (recurrent processing required for consciousness)

Key innovation: Derives α from first principles as α = 1/(1-β), transforming the scaling exponent from a fitted constant into a testable prediction.

Includes 10 explicit falsification criteria and a proposed Global Scaling Challenge for systematic validation.

## Paper III: Cross-Domain Unification (9 February 2026)

### Eastwood's ARC Principle: Cross-Domain Unification of Recursive Amplification Across AI, Quantum Computing, and Physics

**Author:** Michael Darius Eastwood
**Version:** 6.1 | **Date:** 9 February 2026

### Abstract

Between December 2024 and February 2026, four independent research programmes achieved breakthroughs sharing a striking structural pattern. This paper proposes these findings are instances of a single underlying principle:

**U = I × R^α**

Where:
- U = Effective capability
- I = Base potential (structured asymmetry)
- R = Recursive depth
- α = Scaling exponent = 1/(1-β)

### Convergent Evidence

| Domain | System | Key Finding |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| AI | DeepSeek R1 | Sequential α ≈ 1.3-2.2; parallel α ≈ 0 |
| Quantum | Google Willow | Λ = 2.14 exponential error suppression |
| Physics | NYU Time Crystals | Frozen disorder + feedback → temporal order |
| Neuroscience | COGITATE | Recurrence required for consciousness |

### What Makes This Scientific

1. **Falsifiable predictions**: Ten specific ways to prove the framework wrong
2. **Quantitative claims**: Specific α values that can be measured
3. **Independent derivation**: α derived from first principles, not merely fitted
4. **Cross-domain consistency**: Same pattern in unrelated systems
5. **Priority established**: DKIM-verified manuscript predates key discoveries

### AI Disclosure

This paper was prepared with AI assistance from Claude Opus 4.5/4.6, GPT-5.2, Gemini 3 Pro, and DeepSeek v3.2. The theoretical framework, research direction, and core insights are human work.
